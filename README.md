# The Database
This is the video database where all the scraped links are stored.

[nsfw.txt](nsfw.txt) hold links that were grabbed from NSFW servers

Although the [original link list](discord_cdn_links.txt) is not named NSFW, you will still find NSFW content there. Our NSFW list was created after our original list.

Our website does not currently use the NSFW list. That can change in the future.


## Contributing
If you want to add your own links this is what you need to do:
1. Choose what database you are going to be adding the links to. NSFW goes to nsfw.txt and normal videos to discord_cdn_links.txt
2. Open an issue requesting to add links and mention what database you want them added to
3. Upload your links as a text file to the issue and submit, we will notify you when we have merged them to the database

> Upload NSFW links to the NSFW database if you know that the channel you are currently scanning is filled with NSFW stuff.
> Uploading links to the wrong database will result in the issue being closed (you can ask us to put it in another database if you want)
> If you don't think there is NSFW stuff in a channel you are scanning or if the chances of encountering it are low you can upload it to the normal database
