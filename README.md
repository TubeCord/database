# The Database
This is the video database where all the scraped links are stored.

[discord_cdn_links.txt](discord_cdn_links.txt) Holds the normal database that didn't specifically scan known NSFW channels/servers.

[NSFW.txt](nsfw.txt) Holds links that were grabbed from NSFW servers/channels.

Although the [original link list](discord_cdn_links.txt) is not named NSFW, you may still find NSFW videos there. The NSFW database was created separately from our main database.

Our website does not currently use the NSFW list. This may be changed in the future.


## Contributing
If you want to add the links you scraped this is what you need to do:
1. Choose what database you are going to be adding the links to. NSFW goes to [NSFW.txt](nsfw.txt) and normal videos to [discord_cdn_links.txt](discord_cdn_links.txt).
2. Open an issue requesting to add links and mention what database you want them added to.
3. Upload your links as a text file to the issue and submit, we will mark the issue as resolved when we have merged them to the database.

> Upload NSFW links to the NSFW database if you know that the channel you are currently scanning is filled with NSFW stuff.
> Uploading links to the wrong database will result in the issue being closed (you can ask us to put it in another database if you want)
> If you don't think there is NSFW stuff in a channel you are scanning or if the chances of encountering it are low you can upload it to the normal database.
